Supply Chain Management Simulation Project
Project Overview

This project focused on supply chain network design and optimization, combining demand forecasting, order allocation, and transportation planning.
Our team competed in a simulation challenge where performance was evaluated based on overall profit.

Role and Responsibilities

Collaborated in an 8-member team, responsible for forecasting market demand across 5 regions.

Applied machine learning methods for seasonal demand prediction.

Designed a cross-regional supply network, including factory-to-warehouse allocations.

Developed ordering strategies with dynamic adjustment of order quantities and replenishment plans.

Key Outcomes

Optimized both inventory cost and transportation mode selection.

Team achieved 1st place in profit ranking, outperforming the 2nd place by $20,000.

Strengthened expertise in data-driven decision making, logistics optimization, and team collaboration.

Deliverables

Demand forecasting models (machine learning based).

Supply network design and optimization strategy.

Simulation results with profit ranking and performance metrics.
